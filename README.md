## Proposal

My proposal is to design a graphical user interface that allows companies to send surveys to their clients. The goal of this is to give businesses access to software that offers a tonne of customization and is cost-effective. The programme will allow users to design and disseminate surveys, gather replies, analyse the results, and provide reports. This means that the software must have customization options while also not being overly complex and intimidating for both the businesses and the clients who will be receiving the survey.

The ten usability heuristics will serve as the foundation for the UI (user interface), which will make the software robust and effective while reducing challenges and confusion for users. There will be three heuristics that this software will be heavily based around: User control and freedom, flexibility and efficiency of use, and aesthetic and minimalist design. User control and freedom will allow me to focus on making sure the software doesn't make decisions for the user, but only suggest which paths the user can take. Doing this will allow for users to have freedom to decide and take the actions they see fit. Flexibility and efficiency of use will allow for both inexperienced and experienced users to navigate and use the software. This means that inexperienced users may need more detailed information, but as they keep using the software they will become experienced users. As a result, allowing them to customise processes through keyboard shortcuts could be a good function to implement. Aesthetic and minimalist design allows the software to have a visually pleasing UI. Aesthetics are important as they allow a good first impression, a good perception of the interface, and an established and reinforced brand identity and credibility. Minimalist design allows unnecessary noise in the interface so the essential elements can be emphasised, as well eliminates any elements that do not support the users tasks

Components in this software:
This software will be divided into three major components that will cohere to create a robust totality, which will give users confidence in the working of the software.

Database:
The database portion of this project will contain surveys that businesses frequently use as well as a history function. This will enable businesses to meet the criteria for flexibility and usability, since they won't have to create the same or similar surveys more than once, and the history feature will provide them some assurance if they fail to save a survey to the database by accident.
Login system:
Users will be able to log into the programme via the login system portion of this project, and their saved surveys will be restricted to that login alone. Security measures in the login system will make it difficult for other users to access a user's login.
Searching system:
Users who have access to a certain login, will be able to search surveys that were saved to the database. This satisfies the software's efficiency requirements and makes it simpler to search the database.
